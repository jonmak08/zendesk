# Article Pages

We are using the [multiple templates](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001948367) feature for articles. 

## How this works
When a content writer creates an article, depending on the type of that article (knowledge base article, official documentation article, or general information article). The writer can go into *article settings* > *template* in the article interface and select the template that best represents the target audience of the content.

## Types of Articles
- General Article
- Knowledge Base Article
- Zendesk Default Article
- Default (Official Documentation Article)

### General Article
This is a general purpose article designed for information such as FAQ, service level agreements and coverage details.

### Knowledge Base Article
This is an article aimed to promote knowledge sharing and help customers find solutions before needing to reach out to an agent. It contains a sidebar of **Related Articles** to increase article visibility.

### Zendesk Default Article
This is the Zendesk out of the box template with custom styling. It displays a navigation on the left side of the article containing all the articles in the current section.

Content in Zendesk are organized in the following hierarchy: *Category* > *Section* > *Article*

### Default
This is the template for **Official Documentations**. Official documentations are a set of content geared towards a more technical audience.

This template contains a navigation on the left side that allows the user access to more content. It displays all the section headings in the category of the current article. When a user clicks on a section relevant to their needs, a list of articles organized under that section shows up. The current article is always expanded and highlighted.
